<p>Having a consistent strategy across the system for error handling is very important in any application. The side
    effects of not having a good error handling &amp; reporting solution are often seen when the system has gone live
    and the operation team struggle to keep the system running in case of any problem. In this post I suggest few
    guidelines for a coherent error handling.</p>
<h2>Objectives of Error Handling</h2>
<p>The goal of successful Error Handling strategy is to</p>
<ul>
    <li>to detect software fault, exception conditions, system errors and failures and</li>
    <li>to define procedures handle them internally and / or gracefully notify the user</li>
</ul>
<p>Objective of error handling strategy is to define all actions and conventions required to properly handle errors in
    software application.</p>
<p>The following are the main objectives of the Error Handling Strategy:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Implement an error handling mechanism that is consistent between all of the components across solution</li>
    <li>Format of the error codes to be consistent across all components</li>
    <li>Define unique error codes to allow appropriate classification of the error source and category</li>
    <li>To identify where the error has occurred precisely from the source of the issue</li>
    <li>To understand the incident type and severity clearly</li>
    <li>To raise Alarms appropriately to the right team supporting the application and handle the error condition
        quickly and precisely
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Application logs should include data to</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide information about problems and unusual conditions</li>
    <li>Contribute additional application-specific data for incident investigation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements of Error Handling</h2>
<p>The primary requirements or the expectations of the any error handling strategy are</p>
<ul>
    <li>Log information such as What (Error Code) and Where (Transaction ID) when an Event of Exception has occurred.
        Exception events should be enriched with Error Codes that have unique format and Event ID unique to the
        transaction and logged.
    </li>
    <li>The error events are notified appropriately to the
        <ul>
            <li>End users</li>
            <li>Application support</li>
            <li>Infrastructure support</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>as relevant.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Diagnostic procedures are defined so that the exceptions can be diagnosed to be reproduced and the error
        condition can be corrected or fixed as appropriate.
    </li>
    <li>The application can handle all of the exception conditions gracefully and can continue to process the
        transactions or the user requests successfully.
    </li>
    <li>In fatal conditions the transactions are terminated gracefully or notified to all relevant parties and the
        transaction/session terminated gracefully depending on the condition.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>At the bottom line there are only two options when an exception occurs in the system</p>
<ul>
    <li>Catch and handle the exception, so that the application can continue as normal, or,</li>
    <li>If the exception is severe and cannot be handled, then close the relevant resources such as database connection
        notify the users gracefully and terminate the current transaction / session.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The success of an exception handling system comes from categorically handling the exceptions by correctly detecting
    the level of the error condition and raising so that the right users of the system can successfully handle the error
    condition in the best possible way.</p>
<p>Apart from handling and notifying the exception conditions a good error handling strategy can also define the Fix
    Descriptions or Operating Procedures for those error conditions as guidance for the operator personnel to follow to
    fix the issues.</p>
<h2>Message Severity</h2>
<p>It is always a good idea to use possible levels of Severities to categorize the error handling. Categorizing the
    errors to ERROR/CRITICAL/FATAL categories will enable the Application Support to prioritize the incidents.</p>
<h3>FATAL</h3>
<p>A system error or failure has occurred. Errors that cause system crash resulting in loss or corruption of unsaved
    data. A particular system is in an unusable state while other parts of the system continue to function. Automatic
    recovery is not possible; the immediate attention of the administrator is needed to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Fatal errors that the error cannot be recovered from before it is fixed by the support team for eg. unsupported
    Encoding Exception.</p>
<h3>CRITICAL</h3>
<p>An application error has occurred. The system can recover but there might be a momentary loss or degradation of
    service. The immediate attention of the administrator required to fix the problem and prevent it from happening in
    the future. These generally used to indicate a failure in secondary system, such as, when a subsystem isn&rsquo;t
    available momentarily.</p>
<p>For eg. Failure of the Java VM and memory allocation error falls into this category. Manual intervention is required
    to fix this type of error before retrying again.</p>
<h3>ERROR</h3>
<p>A user error has occurred. The system or application can handle the error with no interruption and limited
    degradation of service. Retrying could fix these type errors. Typically are non-urgent errors, and can be solved in
    a given time frame.</p>
<p>Validation Errors falls into this category.</p>
<h3>WARNING</h3>
<p>A suspicious operation or configuration has occurred but it might not affect normal operation. There are not error
    messages, but an indication that an error will occur if no action is taken.</p>
<h3>INFO</h3>
<p>A low-level informational message; used for reporting normal operations. These messages may be used for reporting and
    measuring the throughput of the system. Developers should make sure only &ldquo;no action required&rdquo; messages
    are logged in using this level. Info level message could be a csv list of parameters and values exchanged at that
    point of transaction.</p>
<h3>DEBUG</h3>
<p>A debug message used for internal debugging during development and system test. Any information that is useful during
    operations MUST not be part of DEBUG level messages.</p>
<h2>Error Codes</h2>
<p>The aim is to achieve a consistent format for the error codes that can identify each business and functional errors
    uniquely across all of the components in the solution.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the consistency across the error handling in the solution, it is required that</p>
<ul>
    <li>the format of the Error codes to be unique and consistent and</li>
    <li>use standard Error object to capture and log the exceptions between all Components within the project</li>
</ul>
<p>One example of generating the error codes can be to use a combination of package name, an acronym and a serial
    number. The package name and defines the range of the error codes in conjunction with the four digit serial number
    starting from 0001 as in the format below:</p>
<p>&lt;PACKAGE NAME&gt; + &lt;ACRONYM&gt; + 0001&hellip;9999</p>

        reporting mechanism</p>
