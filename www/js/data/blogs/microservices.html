<h3>What Is a Microservice?</h3><p>Let’s start off with a clear definition of what a microservice is:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A small service that does one thing well</li>
    <li>Independent</li>
    <li>Owner of its own data</li>
</ul><h3>Some Benefits of Microservices</h3><p>Microservices offer a number of benefits over the traditional multi-tier,
    monolithic architectures. Let’s list down them:</p>
<ul>
    <li>With microservices, architects and developers can choose fit for purpose architectures and technologies for each
        microservice (polyglot architecture). This gives the flexibility to design better-fit solutions in a more
        cost-effective way.
    <li>As services are fairly simple and smaller in size, enterprises can afford to experiment new processes,
        algorithms, business logic, and so on. It enables enterprises to do disruptive innovation by offering the
        ability to experiment and fail fast.
    </li>
    <li>Microservices enable to implement selective scalability i.e. each service could be independently scaled up or
        down and cost of scaling is comparatively less than monolithic approach.
    </li>
    <li>Microservices are self-contained, independent deployment modules enabling the substitution of one microservice
        with another similar microservice, when second one is not performing as per our need. It helps in taking right
        buy-versus-build decisions which are often the challenge for many enterprises.
    </li>
    <li>Microservices help us build systems that are organic in nature(Organic systems are systems that grow laterally
        over a period of time by adding more and more functions to it). Because microservices are all about
        independently manageable services – it enable to add more and more services as the need arises with minimal
        impact on the existing services.
    </li>
    <li>Technology changes are one of the barriers in software development. With microservices, it is possible to change
        or upgrade technology for each service individually rather than upgrading an entire application.
    </li>
    <li>As microservices package the service runtime environment along with the service itself, this enables having
        multiple versions of the service to coexist in the same environment.
    </li>
    <li>And finally, microservices also enable smaller, focused agile teams for development. Teams will be organized
        based on the boundaries of microservices.
    </li>
</ul><h3>Your Best Practices for Microservices Checklist</h3><p>If you want to build friendly, sustainable
    microservices, here’s a good checklist:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Helpful documentation</li>
    <li>Built with monitoring and troubleshooting in mind</li>
    <li>Easily deployable and scalable</li>
    <li>Easy to consume</li>
    <li>Coexists with established conventions</li>
</ul><p>Always be sure to make your service easy to deploy and scale. Provide consistent error messaging and make sure
    your microservice consumers can hit the API directly in a nonproduction environment.</p>
