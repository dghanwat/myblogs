<p>Robots, chatbots, conversational agents call them whatever you want, one thing is for sure they have arrived in full
    force and are there to stay. Facebook and other companies are betting heavily on bot technology.</p>
<p>The idea is that these chatbots will eventually be a way for us to easily find anything that we're looking for,
    without having to do a Web search or open up multiple apps.</p>
<h3>What is a Chatbot</h3>
<p>These are very similar to apps like Siri or Cortana, but with few differences. First, most chatbots learn from past
    conversations and don't just answer questions. For example a bot can automatically check the weather forecast and
    remind to bring your umbrella with you, without you need to ask it</p>
<p>Chatsbots are heavily loaded with AI capabilities, so it can start expecting what we'll ask. They won't just serve up
    answers, but make suggestions before we even ask.</p>
<p>Chatbots may eventually evolve into more general personal assistants, or merge with what we already have.</p>
<h3>Business Uses</h3>
<p>Today&rsquo;s business like Ola, Uber can you todays main messaging tools(Messenger, WhatsApp, etc.) to communicate
    with customers almost as naturally as a customer care executive would.</p>
<p>I feel bots can complete, or replace, mobile apps. For many companies mobile apps have lived up to their
    expectations. Today&rsquo;s customer expects 24/7 service and quick answers to their queries without frustrating
    wait of a typical IVR system. For example to log a simple complain a customer would prefer to just chat with a bot
    and log a complain rather to call a customer service desk and go through various options before reaching the
    customer executive.&nbsp; Bots could, therefore, succeed where apps have failed, or supplement the unsatisfactory
    areas.</p>
<p>Another area where bots can be of useful is to allow users to interact with software and databases, rather than
    undertake difficult tasks themselves that could easily be automated. For example you can upload multiple invoices
    and ask a bot who owes me what</p>
<p>What do you think of the potential ??</p>
