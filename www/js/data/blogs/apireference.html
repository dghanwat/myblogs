<p>Today&rsquo;s software is built as services. Rather than using web frameworks that invoke services and produce web
    pages, today's applications are built by consuming and producing APIs.</p>
<p>Applications use API in front ent to build rich client responsive user interface. Applications also use API to build
    powerful business services.</p>
<p>You can find most software companies have embraced API oriented Design.</p>
<p>In this post I will write about some points to consider while designing API based software</p>
<p>Here are the main concepts I tried to apply when designing the API:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Easy to learn ; the documentation provides simple examples, complete documentation</li>
    <li>Easy to use ; single entry point, standard parameters</li>
    <li>Hard to misuse ; explicit error message suggesting parameters values</li>
    <li>Appropriate to audience ; I talked about such a service with several users, and looked at what the competition
        was offering
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The widespread adoption of the basic conventions of API design&mdash;RESTful design, JSON-based data, simple
    versioning, and key-based access control&mdash;means that developers can easily build APIs into their
    applications</p>
